 ## What
Interfaces with a Daihatsu Hijet S210P over the OBD2 port to add an LCD display with coolant temperature and battery voltage, and a physical tachometer gauge. 
 ## Why
 The truck I made this for has no tach. It's a manual transmission and with other modifications that were made (as well as a gaping skill issue), going by sound is infeasible.
 ## Code quality
 Not good. This is a shitty script while I make the [real one](https://github.com/paulwrath1223/to-rust-a-gauge) in async rust.
